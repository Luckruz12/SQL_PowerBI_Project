## Project Motivation/Backgroud
The rapid evolution of the industry has made it essential for job seekers, employers, and educators to stay updated on current market trends. This project was inspired by the need to understand which skills, qualifications, and roles are mostly valued inthe remote data analysis job market, and to provide actionable insights for career and curriculum development. 
## The Questions I Answeredüòï 
1. Which specific skills are most in demand for remote Data Analyst positions?
